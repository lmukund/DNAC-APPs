# Emergency Response Detection System

This folder contains the code for using a cascade classifier to identify if there is fire. The further extension would be to ensure that when the fire was detected, only the Emergency Response Personnel would be able to access the Network. This is similar to the application done in PriD.

##### Requirements
  - Python 2.7  
  - Requests 
  - Opencv

# Steps to Run the Application
  - Run ```fireDetection.py``` to detect fire in the image.
  - Ctrl + C to quit the application.
